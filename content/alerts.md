# About emergency alerts

Emergency Alerts is a Samland government service that will warn you if there's a danger to life nearby.

In an emergency, your mobile phone, tablet, television, or radio will receive an alert with advice about how to stay safe.

> The government does not need to know your phone number or location to send you an alert.
